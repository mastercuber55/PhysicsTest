# PhysicsTest
A really simple game to just play around with [Chipmunk Physics](https://chipmunk-physics.net/) on Android. Its basically a fun time pass project.
I will use the phone's rotation, sort of like direction towards the ground and set gravity to apply in that direction resulting in a dynamic gravity 
thing virtually in chipmunk world and a realastic gravity in the physical world i.e. in real life. And yes. I'll use Pebble and raylib with Frax Framework.
